How It Works

1. Adding a Task:

When you type a task in the input box and click "ADD" or press Enter, the task is added to the list below.



2. Marking a Task as Complete:

A checkbox next to each task allows you to mark it as completed. Completed tasks are visually updated with a line-through.



3. Deleting a Task:

A delete button for each task allows you to remove it from the list.



4. Saving Tasks:

Every task you add, complete, or delete is automatically saved in the browser's local storage. This ensures your tasks are available even after you refresh the page.

How the App Works Internally

1. HTML:

The app uses HTML to create the structure of the To-Do List. It includes an input box for tasks, a button to add them, and an area where tasks are displayed.


2. CSS:

Styling makes the app visually appealing. It uses modern design principles such as:

Dark mode with contrasting text and background colors.

Custom styles for buttons, checkboxes, and text.

Responsive design for smooth use on smaller screens.



3. JavaScript:

JavaScript handles all the functionality:

Captures the task entered in the input field.

Adds tasks dynamically to the list.

Toggles the "completed" status when a checkbox is clicked.

Deletes tasks when the delete button is pressed.

Saves and retrieves tasks from localStorage.
